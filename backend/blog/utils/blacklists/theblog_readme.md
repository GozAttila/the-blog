# The Blog Project

This project includes functionality for validating usernames and blog titles using blacklists and whitelists to prevent inappropriate content. The blacklists used are publicly available and can be updated regularly.

## Resources Used

The blacklists used in this project are sourced from the following repositories:

- [LDNOOBW - List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words/tree/master)
- [The Big Username Blocklist](https://github.com/marteinn/The-Big-Username-Blocklist/tree/main)

Admins can manage their own custom whitelists and blacklists for added flexibility.
